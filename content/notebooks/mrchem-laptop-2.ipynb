    "\n",
    "We provide some GTO NMR data that can serve as a comparison (computed with the `ORCA` code using aug-pcJ-1, aug-pcJ-2, aug-pcJ-3, and aug-pcJ-4 London orbitals).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MWn` notation is a shorthand for a relative precision of `1.0e-n`, and is commonly used to refer to calculations of different precisions (analogous to the DZ, TZ, QZ... notation for GTO basis sets).\n",

    " 4. Extract the relevant information from either the `jobname.out` file or the `jobname.json` file.\n",
