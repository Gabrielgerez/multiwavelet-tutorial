    "In this exercise you will use the MRChem code to perform simple energy optimizations of a water molecule, using different MultiWavelet precision levels.\n",

    "\n",
    "The `MWn` notation is a shorthand for a MW precision of `1.0e-n`, and is commonly used to refer to calculations of different precisions (analogous to the DZ, TZ, QZ... notation for GTO basis sets).\n",

    "Open a new Jupyter Lab terminal by from the Jupyter Launcher (blue button with white \"+\").\n",
    "This works like any other linux terminal, and you can edit input files and look at output files here to complete the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "MRChem with OpenMP parallelization should already be pre-installed from our conda distribution.\n",
    "In order to start an MRChem calculation, you just call the input parser (`mrchem`) from the command line like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "export OMP_NUM_THREADS=16\n",
    "mrchem jobname.inp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will parse the *user* input file (`jobname.inp`) and generate a *program* input file in JSON format (`jobname.json`), and then pass the program input to the binary MRChem executable and redirect `stdout` to the output file (`jobname.out`). The output is also stored in `jobname.json` in JSON format in a separate output section, and this file serves as a complete record of the calculation (including both the input and output). In the example above, MRChem will use 16 threads as defined in the `OMP_NUM_THREADS` environment variable. \n",

    "* Use a KAIN SCF accelerator history of 5.\n",

    " 1. Generate the necessary input files necessary. You can either do this in your favorite command line text editor, or write Python scripts from within the notebook.\n",
    " \n",
    " 2. Submit the calculations as described above.\n",
    " \n",
